SUSPECTED FORMULA FOR KRABBY PATTY:
(updated 5/9/2004 following The Incident)

Sodium lauryl sulfate (industrial-grade degreaser for the "bun glaze")
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) (but 100x the legal limit for "flavor enhancement")
Hydrogenated palm kernel oil (to give the patty an unnaturally shiny surface)
Potassium sorbate (preservative)
Ammonium sulfate (meat-like texture stabilizer)
Propylene glycol (anti-freeze for patty moisture)
Disodium inosinate and guanylate (to fake the umami taste of real meat)
Sodium hexametaphosphate (keeps the cheese slices from melting, ever)
Benzoyl peroxide (for whitening the mayonnaise)
Artificial shrimp extract (added to the ketchup to confuse the senses)
Titanium dioxide (used in paint, but here for extra "whiteness" in the bun)
Dimethylpolysiloxane (normally found in caulk, but in the "special sauce" for texture)
Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) (to stop the bun from molding for decades)
Yellow 5 Lake and Red 40 (to make the pickles look radioactive)
